# Ticker
The goal of Ticker is to aggregate news, presenting similar topics from a variety
of perspectives. In theory, this sounds like a great idea. In practice howver,
RSS feeds were not suitable for naieve, rule-based NLP or unsupervised learning.
Content is too hard to corral and sufficiently group based solely on information
provided in RSS feeds.

This project was largely abandoned. [Google News](https://news.google.com/)
provides all of the functionality I wanted from a news aggregation tool. Google's
product is better than anything I could come up with.

None-the-less, I'm pushing this repository for lessons-learned. Maybe you can
glean something from it.
